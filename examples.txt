	Prerequisites:

	- the BE uses RFC2617, which is the standard HTTP-authentication with digest
	- the FE uses HTTP-authentication with username:password

	Notes:

	- the FE will not report that you don't use (a valid) user for authentification.
	  that is because a lot of the services available through the FE don't even need
	  authentification (modification methods like PUT/POST/DELETE do bounce though).

	1. Using the CURL command-line tool

		You can use the BE with digest this way:
		$ curl -S --request GET --digest --user username:password http://domain.tld/typo3/services/
		You can use the FE this way:
		$ curl -S --request GET --user username:password http://domain.tld/services/
